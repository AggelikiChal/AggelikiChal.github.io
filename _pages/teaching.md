**Secondary e-mail**: tolis.chal@gmail.com    

## Status

Since April 2022, I work at Quantagonia as Research Engineer. I am developing Optimization, Simulation, and Artificial Intelligence models and their implementations for today's high-performance computers, and for later use on quantum computers via Quantagonia's new Quantum Virtual Platform.

My complete CV can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1t244k-q2A3-VQh6pol6aeM4BsaqWKL1H/view?usp=sharing).

## Profile and interests

My research focuses on geometric random walks and sampling for financial modeling, volume computation, and convex optimization. In particular, my research interests are:

- Mathematical optimization.

- Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling methods for high dimensional multivariate distributions.  
- Portfolio scoring, portfolio optimization, and anomaly detection in big stock markets.  
- Bayesian statistics.  
- Optimized implementation of state-of-the-art randomized, geometric and statistical algorithms.   

I am also an open-source programmer. I have participated in Google Summer of Code 2018 and 2019 as a student. I am the author and maintainer of packages volesti and dingo. I am also a co-founder of GeomScale org, an open research, and development project that delivers open-source code at the intersection of data science, geometric, and statistical computing.
